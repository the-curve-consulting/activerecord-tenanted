## 1. What is Active Record Tenanted?

> [!TIP]
> If you're not familiar with how Rails's built-in horizontal sharding works, it may be worth reading the Rails Guide on [Multiple Databases with Active Record](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_multiple_databases.html#setting-up-your-application) before proceeding.

Active Record Tenanted extends the Rails framework to enable an application to have many tenant-specific databases. It provides data isolation by logically separating each tenant's data, by providing safety mechanisms to help ensure safe usage of Active Record, and by modifying the behavior of many parts of Rails such as fragment caching, Active Job, Action Cable, Active Storage, Global ID, and database tasks. By providing integrated framework support for tenanting, Active Record Tenanted ensures that developers can write the majority of their code as if they were in a single-tenant application without putting tenant privacy and data security at risk.

### 1.1 Guiding design principles

The design of Active Record Tenanted is rooted in a few guiding principles in order to safely allow multiple tenants to share a Rails application instance:

- Data "at rest" is persisted in a separate store for each tenant's data, isolated either physically or logically from other tenants.
- Data "in transit" is only sent to users with authenticated access to the tenant instance.
- All tenant-related code execution must happen within a well-defined isolated tenant context with controls around data access and transmission.

Another guiding principle, though, is:

- Developing a multi-tenant Rails app should be as easy as developing a single-tenant app.

The goal is that developers will rarely need to think about managing tenant isolation.


### 1.2 High-level implementation

Active Record Tenanted extends Active Record to dynamically create a Connection Pool for a tenant on demand. It does this in a thread-safe way by relying heavily on Rails' horizontal sharding features.

It extends Rails' testing frameworks so that tests don't need to explicitly set up a tenant or otherwise be aware of tenanting (unless tenanting behavior is explicitly being tested).

It also provides integrations with Action Dispatch's Rack middleware, Action View Caching, Active Job, Action Cable, Turbo frames and streams, Active Storage, Action Mailbox, and Action Text to ensure that code is always aware of its "tenant context".


### 1.3 Concepts

A "tenant ID" is simply a string (or an integer) that uniquely identifies a subset of data. For example, this may be a subdomain, or a user-chosen name, or a foreign key into a customer database. It's used as part of the name of the database (e.g., the file path to a SQLite file on disk, or the name of a MySQL database) and so there are constraints on the tenant ID.

A "tenant context" refers to the "current tenant" during code execution. For code running in a Rails server, the tenant context is set automatically by Active Record Tenanted's middleware; but in other situations, such as in the Rails console, the context can be set by calling `.with_tenant`:

``` ruby
# When no tenant context is set, "current tenant" is nil:
ApplicationRecord.current_tenant   # => nil

ApplicationRecord.with_tenant("tenant-one") do
  # Inside this block, code runs within "tenant-one"'s context
  ApplicationRecord.current_tenant # => "tenant-one"
  User.current_tenant              # => "tenant-one"

  # ... and uses a connection to "tenant-one"'s database.
  User.connection_pool.db_config.database
  # => storage/tenants/development/tenant-one/db/main.sqlite3

  # ... so that SQL queries are executed on "tenant-one"'s database
  user = User.find(1)
  # User Load [tenant=tenant-one] (1.3ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = ? LIMIT ?  [["id", 1], ["LIMIT", 1]]
end
```

Note that a "tenant attribute" is set on all model instances, to reflect the tenant to which it belongs:

``` ruby
ApplicationRecord.with_tenant("tenant-one") do
  user = User.find(1)
  user.tenant                      # => "tenant-one"
end
```

Access to the database without a tenant context raises an exception:

``` ruby
ApplicationRecord.current_tenant   # => nil
User.find(1)                       # raises ActiveRecord::Tenanted::NoTenantError
```


### 1.4 Prior Art

Released in 2008, the [`acts_as_tenant`](https://github.com/ErwinM/acts_as_tenant) gem allows an application to isolate tenant data that is commingled in a single database. It relies on Active Record associations and applies tenant constraints using scopes, and offers middleware tenant resolution. It provides very limited integration with the rest of the Rails framework.

In 2009, Guy Naor spoke at Acts As conference on [Writing Multi-tenant Applications in Rails 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QstBE0Bfj8), which provides details on many aspects of multi-tenancy.

Released in 2011, the [`apartment`](https://github.com/rails-on-services/apartment) gem extends Active Record to make dynamic connections to tenant-specific databases. It provides more substantial data isolation than However, it relies on a primitive reconnection mechanism that pre-dates Rails 6.1's thread-safe sharding model. It also provides only limited integration with the rest of the Rails framework.

In December 2020, [Rails 6.1 was released](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/6_1_release_notes.html) with support for horizontal sharding and multi-database. This functionality provided new thread-safe capabilities for connection switching in Rails.

In early 2025, Julik Tarkhanov published a [tenanting implementation named "Shardine"](https://blog.julik.nl/2025/04/a-can-of-shardines) that uses the Rails sharding API. However, it also provided very limited integration with the rest of the Rails framework.


### 1.5 Shared state (WIP)

- when we talk about "integration with the rest of rails" we're talking about Rails' assumptions about shared state
- some of these assumptions are now busted
  - database ids are no longer unique
  - global ids are no longer global
  - cache is no longer global
  - cable channels are no longer global
  - jobs are no longer global


## 2. Application Configuration

This gem offers an "omakase" configuration that specifies:

1. All models inheriting from `ApplicationRecord` will be tenanted.
2. The subdomain of the request will be used to determine the tenant context.

These defaults can be overridden using the configuration options:

- `config.active_record_tenanted.connection_class`
- `config.active_record_tenanted.tenant_resolver`

This gem also introduces behavior changes into Rails to accommodate tenanting. All of these behavior changes can be disabled by setting `config.active_record_tenanted.connection_class` to `nil`.


### 2.1 The Default Configuration

To install this gem into an application with the defaults, first add the gem:

``` diff
--- a/Gemfile
+++ b/Gemfile
@@ -3,6 +3,7 @@ git_source(:bc) { |repo| "https://github.com/basecamp/#{repo}" }
 ruby file: ".ruby-version"

 gem "rails", github: "rails/rails", branch: "main"
+gem "activerecord-tenanted"

 # Assets & front end
 gem "importmap-rails"
```

Extend your ApplicationRecord models:

``` diff
--- a/app/models/application_record.rb
+++ b/app/models/application_record.rb
@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
 class ApplicationRecord < ActiveRecord::Base
   primary_abstract_class
+  tenanted
 end
```

Extend your database configuration:

``` diff
--- a/config/database.yml
+++ b/config/database.yml
@@ -12,7 +12,8 @@ default: &default
 production:
   primary:
     <<: *default
-    database: storage/production.sqlite3
+    database: storage/production/%{tenant}/main.sqlite3
+    tenanted: true
   cable:
     <<: *default
     database: storage/production_cable.sqlite3
```

In this configuration, `ApplicationRecord` classes and instances will be extended with tenant behavior:

``` ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord ; end

ApplicationRecord.current_tenant   # => nil

ApplicationRecord.with_tenant("tenant-one") do
  ApplicationRecord.current_tenant # => "tenant-one"
  User.current_tenant              # => "tenant-one"
  user = User.find(1)
  user.tenant                      # => "tenant-one"
end
```

And in this configuration, the `TenantSelector` middleware will automatically set the tenant context base on the request subdomain. A request to `tenant-one.example.com` will resolve to tenant ID `"tenant-one"`, and all code that runs in the application as part of request handling will automatically be in this context:

``` ruby
class BooksController < ApplicationController
  def index
    Book.current_tenant # => "tenant-one" for a request to "tenant-one.example.com"
  end
end
```


### 2.2 Configuring the Database

By default, Active Record Tenanted will connect `ApplicationRecord` to tenanted shards based on the `primary` database configuration.

This can be overridden with an argument to `tenanted` with the name of the database. For example, if the `database.yml` file contained this configuration:

``` yaml
production:
  primary:
    adapter: mysql2
    database: primary_db
  secondary:
    adapter: sqlite3
    database: "storage/tenants/%{tenant}/main.sqlite3"
    tenanted: true
```

then the models could be configured as follows:

``` ruby
class ApplicationRecord < ActiveRecord::Base
  primary_abstract_class
  tenanted "secondary"
end
```

This approach also works for primary database that aren't named "primary":

``` yaml
production:
  tenant_db:
    adapter: sqlite3
    database: "storage/tenants/%{tenant}/main.sqlite3"
    tenanted: true
  secondary:
    adapter: mysql2
    database: primary_db
```

``` ruby
class ApplicationRecord < ActiveRecord::Base
  primary_abstract_class
  tenanted "tenant_db"
end
```

### 2.3 Configuring `max_connection_pools`

By default, Active Record Tenanted will cap the number of tenanted connection pools to 50. Setting a limit on the number of "live" connection pools at any one time provides control over the number of file descriptors used for database connections. For SQLite databases, it's also an important control on the amount of memory used.

The cap on the number of connection pools is configurable in `config/database.yml` by setting a `max_connection_pools` parameter:

``` yaml
production:
  primary:
    adapter: sqlite3
    database: "storage/tenants/%{tenant}/main.sqlite3"
    tenanted: true
    max_connection_pools: 20
```

Active Record Tenanted will reap the least-recently-used connection pools when this limit is surpassed. Developers are encouraged to tune this parameter with care, since setting it too low may lead to increased request latency due to frequently re-establishing database connections, while setting it too high may consume precious file descriptors and memory resources.


### 2.4 Configuring the Connection Class

By default, Active Record Tenanted assumes that `ApplicationRecord` is the tenanted abstract base class:

``` ruby
# Set this in an initializer if you're tenanting a connection class other than
# ApplicationRecord. This value indicates the connection class that this gem uses to integrate
# with a broad set of Rails subsystems, including:
#
# - Active Job
# - Active Storage
# - Action Cable
# - Action Dispatch middleware (Tenant Selector)
# - Test frameworks and fixtures
#
# Defaults to "ApplicationRecord", but this can be set to `nil` to turn off the integrations
# entirely.
config.active_record_tenanted.connection_class = "ApplicationRecord"
```

Applications may override this to tenant a different abstract connection class. For example, to connect some models to the "secondary" database in this configuration:

``` yaml
production:
  primary:
    adapter: mysql2
    database: primary_db
  secondary:
    adapter: sqlite3
    database: "storage/tenants/%{tenant}/main.sqlite3"
    tenanted: true
```

A new abstract connection class could be defined and configured as follows:

``` ruby
# define the abstract connection class
class TenantedApplicationRecord < ActiveRecord::Base
  self.abstract_class = true
  tenanted "secondary"
end

# concrete tenanted models inherit from TenantedApplicationRecord
class User < TenantedApplicationRecord ; end

# make sure the Rails integrations use the desired connection class
Rails.application.configure do
  config.active_record_tenanted.connection_class = "TenantedApplicationRecord"
end
```


### 2.5 Configuring the Tenant Resolver

Active Record Tenanted's default tenant resolver uses the request's subdomain:

``` ruby
# Set this to a lambda that takes a request object and returns the tenant name. It's used by:
#
# - Action Dispatch middleware (Tenant Selector)
# - Action Cable connections
#
# Defaults to the request subdomain.
config.active_record_tenanted.tenant_resolver = ->(request) { request.subdomain }
```

Applications may override this with their own lambda that wraps more complex tenant resolution logic. For example:

``` ruby
module TenantSlug
  def self.resolve(request)
    # complex behavior to pull the tenant out of the request path
  end
end

# configure Active Record Tenanted in an initializer
Rails.application.configure do
  config.active_record_tenanted.tenant_resolver = ->(request) { TenantSlug.resolve(request) }
end
```

### 2.6 Other Tenant Configuration

TODO:

- talk about connection_class and disabling integrations
- `tenanted_rails_records`
- `log_tenant_tag`
- `default_tenant`


### 2.7 Related Rails Configurations

TODO:

- explain why we set some options
  - `active_record.use_schema_cache_dump = true`
  - `active_record.check_schema_cache_dump_version = false`

  - but those non-fixture databases will be cleaned up at the start of the test suite
- explain `without_tenant`
- example of:
  - unit test with fixtures
  - integration test
  - sytem test

TODO:

- testing
  - [x] a `without_tenant` test helper
  - [x] set up test helper to default to a tenanted named "test-tenant"

  - [x] allow the creation of tenants within transactional tests


### Caching

Documentation outline:

- explain why we need to be careful
- explain how active record objects' cache keys have tenanting built in
- explain why we're not worried about collection caching and partial caching (?)
- explain why we're not worried about russian doll caching
- explain why calling Rails.cache directly requires care that it's either explicitly tenanted or global
- explain why we're not worried about sql query caching (it belongs to the connection pool)


TODO:

- [x] make basic fragment caching work
- [x] investigate: is collection caching going to be tenanted properly
- [x] investigate: make sure the QueryCache executor is clearing query caches for tenanted pool
- [x] do we need to do some exploration on how to make sure all caching is tenanted?
  - I'm making the call not to pursue this. Rails.cache is a primitive. Just document it.

### Action View Fragment Caching

Documentation outline:

- explain how it works (cache keys)

TODO:

- [x] extend `#cache_key` on Base
- [x] extend `#cache_key` on Subtenant


#### Solid Cache

Documentation outline:

- describe one-big-cache and cache-in-the-tenanted-database strategies
  - note that cache-in-the-tenanted-database means there is no global cache
  - note that cache-in-the-tenanted-database is not easily purgeable (today)
  - and so we recommend (?) one big cache in a dedicated database
- how to configure Solid Cache for one-big-cache
- how to configure Solid Cache for tenanted-cache

TODO:

- upstream
  - [ ] feature: make shard swap prohibition database-specific
    - which would work around Solid Cache config wonkiness caused by https://github.com/rails/solid_cache/pull/219


### Action Cable

Documentation outline:

- explain why we need to be careful
- how to tenant a channel
  - make sure to call `super` if you override `#connect`
- how the global id also contains the tenant
- do we need to document each adapter?
  - async
  - test
  - solid_cable
  - redis?

TODO:

- [x] extend the base connection to support tenanting with a `tenanted_connection` method
- [x] reconsider the current API using `tenanted_connection` if we can figure out how to reliably wrap `#connect`
  - did this! prefer to force the app to call super() from `#connect`, it's simpler
- [ ] test disconnection
  - `ActionCable.server.remote_connections.where(current_tenant: "foo", current_user: User.find(1)).disconnect`

- [x] some testing around global id would be good here
- [x] system test of a broadcast update


### Active Job

Documentation outline:

  - ActiveJob including the current tenant,
  - and any passed record being including the tenant in global_id


TODO:

- [x] extend `ActiveJob` to set the tenant in `perform_now`
- [x] extend `to_global_id` and friends for Base
- [x] extend `to_global_id` and friends for Subtenant

- [x] make sure the test helper `perform_enqueued_jobs` wraps everything in a `without_tenant` block


### Active Storage

Documentation outline:

- explain why we need to be careful
- explain how it works
  - if `connection_class` is set, then Active Storage will insert the tenant into the blob key
    - and the disk service will include the tenant in the path on disk in the root location, like: 'foobar/ab/cd/abcd12345678abcd'
- Disk Service can also have a tenanted root path, but it's optional

TODO:

- [x] extend Disk Service to change the path on disk
- [x] extend Blob to have tenanted keys


### ActionMailer

Documentation outline:

- explain how to configure the action mailer default host if needed, with a "%{tenant}" format specifier.


TODO:

- [x] Interpolate the tenant into a host set in config.action_mailer.default_url_options
- [ ] Do we need to do something similar for the asset host?
  - I'm going to wait until someone needs it, because it's not trivial to hijack.
- [ ] Do we need to do something similar for explicit host parameters to url helpers?
  - I don't think so.
  - I'm going to wait until someone needs it, because it's not trivial to hijack.


### ActionMailbox

TODO:

- [ ] I need a use case here around mail routing before I tackle it


### Console

Documentation outline:

- explain the concept of a "default tenant"
- explain usage of the `ARTENANT` environment variable to control startup


### Metrics

Some places we should add instrumentation:

- Creating a new tenant database
- Migrating a tenant database
- Destroying a tenant database
- Creating a tenanted connection pool
- Reaping a tenanted connection pool
