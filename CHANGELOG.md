# `activerecord-tenanted` Changelog

## next / unreleased

### Fixed

- The version in the schema cache dump is checked before the dump is used, as Rails does when `check_schema_cache_dump_version` is on. A tenanted connection pool compares the dump with the schema version of its database. Outside of a tenant context, the dump is compared with the latest migration file on disk. An outdated dump is ignored with a warning instead of being used silently. See [#319](https://github.com/basecamp/activerecord-tenanted/issues/319). @jamesridgway
- The test worker suffix is no longer added a second time to a SQLite database URI that has query params. The check for an existing suffix covered a file path and a URI without query params, but not a URI like `file:storage/%{tenant}/main.sqlite3?vfs=unix-dotfile`, which became `main.sqlite3_1_1?vfs=unix-dotfile` in a parallel test run. @jamesridgway


## v0.8.0 / 2026-08-04

### Breaking change: serialized payloads carry the tenant

A tenanted record now writes its tenant into the payload produced by `Marshal`, JSON, YAML, and MessagePack, so that it keeps its tenant identity when it is loaded in another tenant context or in none. This fixes a hang in parallel test suites, where a worker died reporting an exception that carried a record with a loaded association. See [#243](https://github.com/basecamp/activerecord-tenanted/issues/243). @flavorjones

The payload format changes, and the change is not backward compatible. An earlier version of this gem reading a payload written by this version raises `ActiveModel::UnknownAttributeError` for JSON, and gains a phantom `tenant` attribute for `Marshal` and MessagePack. Payloads written by an earlier version are still read correctly by this version, and keep the loading context as they did before.

Discard persisted payloads before upgrading, including cache entries, enqueued jobs, and serialized columns. Expect the same incompatibility during a rolling deploy, while old and new code run at the same time.

### Breaking change: record equality

`==`, `eql?`, and `#hash` now take the tenant into account. Two records of the same class with the same id in different tenant databases were previously equal, and collided as `Hash` keys and in a `Set`. They are now distinct. Code that compares records across tenants, or that relies on `has_many` assignment treating them as interchangeable, will behave differently. @flavorjones

### Fixed

- `Tenanted::GlobalId::Locator` now inherits from `GlobalID::Locator::UnscopedLocator`, which is the locator Rails uses by default. Two behavior changes follow: GlobalID lookups no longer apply a model's `default_scope`, matching Rails; and `#locate_many` is now implemented, which Active Job on Rails edge requires to deserialize GlobalID arguments. `#locate_many` enforces the same tenant safety checks as `#locate`. @flavorjones
- `Tenanted::GlobalId::Locator` no longer emits a deprecation warning from GlobalID 1.4.0 about the missing `model_class` method. @flavorjones
- The tenant context check now runs when an association reads or writes the database, rather than when the `Association` object is created. A polymorphic association is checked against the class it points at, instead of being presumed tenanted. @flavorjones
- `#reload`, `#destroy`, `#delete`, `#update_column`, `#update_columns`, `#touch`, `#increment!`, `#decrement!`, and `#valid?` check the tenant context before they touch the database. They previously operated on the current tenant's database whatever the record's tenant. @flavorjones
- Assigning a `belongs_to` target that belongs to another tenant now raises `WrongTenantError` when the record is saved, rather than writing a foreign key that points into another tenant's database. @flavorjones
- `UntenantedConnectionPool` implements `#clear_query_cache` as a no-op, having no query cache to clear. `ActiveRecord::Persistence#reload` calls it before it asks for a connection, so an untenanted `#reload` previously raised `NoMethodError` instead of `NoTenantError`. @flavorjones

### Developer infrastructure

- Added `msgpack` as a development dependency, so that the serialization tests can exercise a MessagePack round trip. @flavorjones


## v0.7.0 / 2026-06-08

### Security

- Fixed this gem's override of `ActiveStorage::Service::DiskService#path_for` to match the upstream Rails 8.1.2.1 behavior preventing path traversal. See https://github.com/basecamp/activerecord-tenanted/security/advisories/GHSA-pmwx-rm49-xv39 for more information. @flavorjones

### Dependencies

- Bumped the minimum Rails version requirement to `>= 8.1.2.1` to simplify the `DiskService#path_for` fix. @flavorjones

### Added

- Add callbacks for `:with_tenant` which are invoked when `.with_tenant` is called. @flavorjones
- Add callbacks for `:set_current_tenant` which are invoked when `.current_tenant=` is called. @flavorjones

### Fixed

- `.current_tenant = nil` now clears the tenant context, properly setting the shard to `UNTENANTED_SENTINEL` instead of `""` @flavorjones
- `Tenanted::DiskService#path_for` now handles keys without a tenant prefix (e.g., from `ActiveStorage::FixtureSet.blob`) by falling back to standard DiskService behavior. @flavorjones

### Developer infrastructure

- Hardened Github Actions workflows. @flavorjones
- Added matrix testing against Rails 8.1 and Rails edge. @flavorjones


## v0.6.0 / 2025-11-05

### Breaking change: Rake tasks

Some rake task changes to rename tasks for the database name (like Rails does it):

- `db:migrate:DBNAME` replaces `db:migrate:tenant` and `db:migrate:tenant:all`
  - it operates on all tenants by default
  - if there are no tenants it will create a database for the default tenant
  - the `ARTENANT` env var can be specified to run against a specific tenant
- `db:drop:DBNAME` replaces `db:drop:tenant`
  - it operates on all tenants by default
  - NEW: the `ARTENANT` env var can be specified to run against a specific tenant
- `db:reset:DBNAME` replaces `db:reset:tenant`
  - it operates on all tenants by default
  - NEW: the `ARTENANT` env var can be specified to run against a specific tenant
- `Tenanted::DatabaseTasks.base_config` has been removed

Some additional changes:

- `Tenanted::DatabaseTasks` is now a class that takes a tenanted base config as a constructor parameter.
- `ActiveRecord::Tenanted.base_configs` is a new utility method that returns all the tenanted base configs for the current environment.


### Breaking change: SQL query logging

Recent cascading changes on Rails `main` related to structured logging have made it challenging to continue to support log output like this:

```
# old log structure
Account Count [tenant=686465299] (0.1ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "accounts"
```

This version of the gem moves to using a query log tag named `:tenant`, which is more in line with how Rails wants extensions to inject content into the query logs. To use it, set this in your application config:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.active_record.query_log_tags_enabled = true
Rails.application.config.active_record.query_log_tags = [ :tenant ]
```

When configured, the application will emit logs like this:

```
# new log structure
Account Count (0.3ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "accounts" /*tenant='686465299'*/
```

Read the [Rails Guide documentation on `config.active_record.query_log_tags`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-active-record-query-log-tags) for more information on query logs in general.


### Added

- `UntenantedConnectionPool#size` returns the database configuration's `max_connections` value, so that code (like Solid Queue) can inspect config params without a tenant context.


## v0.5.0 / 2025-10-12

### Fixed

- Handle the new parallel testing behavior introduced by rails/rails#55769, unblocking Rails edge upgrades. #216 @flavorjones


### Changed

- The return value from an Active Record model `#cache_key` has changed from `users/1?tenant=foo` to `foo/users/1`. For existing applications, this will invalidate any relevant cache entries. #187 @miguelmarcondesf
- Renamed `ActiveRecord::Tenanted::DatabaseTasks.tenanted_config` to `.base_config`.


### Improved

- SQLite-specific code has been extracted into an adapter object. #204 #215 @andrewmarkle @flavorjones
- For tenanted model instances, `#inspect` now outputs the tenant attribute first, before the column attributes. #191 @lairtonmendes
- The `debug` gem is now available during testing. #200 @andrewmarkle


## v0.4.1 / 2025-09-17

No functional changes from v0.4.0.


## v0.4.0 / 2025-09-17

### Added

- Introduce `max_connection_pools` database configuration to limit the number of tenanted databases with open connections. Pools are reaped in least-recently-used order. #182 @flavorjones
- Documentation: Improved `GUIDE.md`. @flavorjones


### Changed

- Rename `ActiveRecord::Tenanted::DatabaseConfigurations::RootConfig` to `BaseConfig`. @flavorjones
- Rails dependency bumped to `>= 8.1.beta` #172 @andrewmarkle


## v0.3.0 / 2025-09-09

### Improved

- `#inspect` on instances of tenanted models includes the tenant. #155 @miguelmarcondesf @flavorjones
- `TenantSelector` middleware no longer directly renders a 404. Instead, it configures ActionDispatch::ShowExceptions middlware and raises an appropriate exception. #167 @flavorjones


## v0.2.0 / 2025-09-04

First release.


## v0.1.0

Empty gem file to claim the name.
